I am a Software Developer passionate about creating high performance solutions
that take the most advantage they can from the hardware they use. I always code
following the best standards, verifying the code quality with analysis tools
and automated tests. I am a huge fan of maths, process automation, distributed
computing and Open Source.

Since I coded my first lines in Go (July 2018), I knew that its simplicity,
power and philosophy are the experience that any developer pursuing
productivity and efficiency needs. I coded with PHP, Python and JavaScript
(Node.js) in the past. I also finished the 42 C Piscine in Silicon Valley, so I
have basic knowledge of C.
