See the [challenge description](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/binarytrees.html#binarytrees).

The solution to this challenge is not fully compliant to the challenge rules, I 
just wanted to learn about profiling Go programs and tweak them to run as fast
as its C and Rust counter-parts (and indeed it is faster).

# Usage

```shell-session
$ go build -o solution main.go

$ echo 10 | ./solution
```
